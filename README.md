# k8400 vertexfirmware clone 
Velleman K8400 Firmware for personal modifications (based on 2 Heads Version V1.1)

If you bought the k8400 printer **do not use this firmware**, but the original version linked below

Im am not the owner or creator of the firmware. Its here for public because the free github account forces me too (i just want to use the vcs)
For the orginal source code look at: http://www.vertex3dprinter.eu/support/downloads
